### Purpose

- The purpose of this site is to look ahead to future Metal Club (referred to as the Club) meeting topics and to help set up possible concert opportunities with fellow students.

- There will be a monthly calendar with Club meeting dates as well as upcoming
concert dates posted by current students.

- A forum for sharing music that students want others to listen to or discuss
different happenings in the music industry, such as upcoming albums or concerts
or band member mishaps.

- There is a possibilty of the inclusion of a Listing area for student-run bands
who are either looking for members or venue opportunities.

### User Privileges

- Users will be asked to sign in with their current MSU email.
    - The site will be for public use. However, if the user does not have an MSU email,
    they will remain anonymous and will not be able to add to or edit any part of the site.

    - Non-anonymous users will be able to post to the Forum or Listing area, or add an upcoming concert to the calendar.

    - The original founders and future leadership of the Club will have Administrator rights. These rights include:
        - The ability to suspend a user from posting to the Forum or Listing area if
        there is toxic behavior or spam.
        - Capability of removing or creating new Administrator users.
            - **THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF A CURRENT ADMINISTRATOR IS STEPPING DOWN**
            **OR IF NEW CLUB LEADERS HAVE BEEN NAMED**
